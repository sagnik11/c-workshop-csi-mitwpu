# c-workshop-csi-mitwpu
All the codes that were explained in the session for the CSI MIT WPU C workshop have been added over here. I will keep adding new codes and questions for C in case more are needed.

Feel free to reach out to me for any doubts in Languages like C, C++, Javascript and Backend Scripting Languages like NodeJS.

In case you all need new questions that can be helpful for interviews or in any other languages, drop me an email at sagnik@worqhat.com[mailto:sagnik@worqhat.com] or you can WhatsApp me at +91-9960806748
